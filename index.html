      <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Educe provides educators a unique platform to organize, build upon, and
        share their insights. Educators often find themselves overwhelmed by the
        wealth of information they gather during their research endeavors to
        craft compelling lessons for their audience. Educe helps educators
        organize their insights in a meaningful way and also provides a diverse
        array of viewing options, offering fresh perspectives on their
        accumulated knowledge. This capability enables educators to forge
        meaningful connections between past and present ideas. Furthermore,
        educators can leverage Educe's knowledge sharing capability to leave
        their insights with each new audience group so attendees can continue
        learning in their cohort. This functionality not only simplifies the
        process of knowledge dissemination but also creates a unified repository
        where students can store insights garnered from each class or conference
        they attend. Over time, this repository evolves into a comprehensive,
        personalized compendium of insights, providing students with an
        invaluable resource for continuous learning and growth
