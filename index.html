      <h2>Project Synopsis</h2>
      <p>
        Educe is a personal insight app that focuses on developing mental
        acuity. The idea is to provide a platform where people can not only
        consume content for their learning but also track their insights. In
        this way, people can take notes, whether it's during a lecture, a
        meeting, or a class, to revisit later. Educe provides the space for
        these insights and allows them to be categorized for easy access at a
        later date. These organized insights help consumers take away something
        valuable from their learning experiences, ensuring that they don't leave
        a session without their collected insights and thoughts
